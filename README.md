## Research Focus

### **Scientific MNIST Dataset**

The **Scientific MNIST dataset** is central to this repository's focus. This extended version of the classic MNIST dataset provides additional complexity through images of scientific symbols and handwritten figures, offering a rich resource for training and evaluating visual intelligence models. The dataset will be used for various tasks, from basic image classification to detection, segmentation, and other related tasks.

### **Research Paper List**

A curated list of essential research papers, including foundational studies and recent advances, will guide the development of methods tested with the **Scientific MNIST** dataset.


### **Reimplementation of Selected Research Papers**

Key foundational papers/state-of-the-art approaches, will be reimplemented with a focus on their applicability to the **Scientific MNIST** dataset, aiming to refine existing methods and explore new approaches.

### **Comparative Analysis of Research Approaches**

A systematic comparison of selected research papers will be undertaken to critically evaluate the methodological strengths, limitations, and performance variations of different approaches applied to the Scientific MNIST, CIFAR and other relevant datasets.

### **Foundational Code Development (PyTorch)**

The repository will provide efficient and scalable code implementations in Python and PyTorch for working with **Scientific MNIST**, focusing on simplicity, reusability, and performance. The code will also try to focus on efficient model implementation, training pipelines, and optimization techniques, laying the groundwork for further experiments and improvements in the field.

## Long-Term Vision

Building on last year’s foundational work, this repository remains a living archive of inquiry. Each new entities, deepens our evolving understanding of visual intelligence in scientific domains.

This repository reflects an evolving body of work: shaped by deliberate effort, continuous learning, and a continuous attempt at thoughtful progress. While the current state represents a small subset of meaningful work, it remains part of a broader, ongoing journey: open to refinement, extension, and deeper understanding. As with any thoughtful pursuit, the process is dynamic, not definitive.

It serves as a reflection of ongoing exploration rather than a finished destination: a work in progress informed by every question, insight, and perspective encountered along the way. Sustained by curiosity and the steady momentum of iteration, this journey is far from complete. And in that lies its greatest potential.


## Notes


This is a currently ongoing and evolving work. Due to the work's developmental nature, all specific details of the ongoing work have not yet been publicly disclosed. They will be appropriately shared in due course, as the work progresses with care.
